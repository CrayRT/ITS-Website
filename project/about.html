<p>
	E-Novate is a company that develops technologies to improve the future of people. We chose this
	company name because it aligns with our goal of providing unique products that benefit our customers
	through the use of technology. The “E” stands for electronics, which is where the company focuses its
	products. Then “Novate” stands for innovation, as the company designs and builds innovative products
	for greater efficiency and effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
	E-Novate has a company logo that strongly represents who they are. The company logo consists
	of two main points: Ideas and Technology, the logo is a light bulb like shape with electrical circuits to add
	more design. We chose this type of design because the company is a technology type of organization and
	to represent the logo, we think about the endless possibilities of how creativity can be a reality

	E-Novate is a company where innovation of technology is the main priority, and our company
	right now offers a chair and an ID lace that is highly extensive when it comes to it’s design. The people in e-novate did
	countless amounts of research on what would make these products unique and different from other similar product in the world right now.
	And in E-novate, they aim to create the most unique piece of technology for everyone in the world. The target market of the company for these certain products would be
	the office workers and students from the urban areas. The targeted age of this product would be people that are 19 or
	above. The product that E-novate is now offering would be the start of the amount of future technologies
	that they plan to create in the future. E-novate calls their chair the E-Novate R1MK-1, which is a smart
	chair that is highly mobile, highly customizable and provides tons of other features like the smart control
	panel, where all the magic of the chair happens. As for the ID Lace, it is called Emergencyard since it combines a lanyard with light-weight items that could help during an emergency.
